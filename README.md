This is my Coursework for Network management course .It covers Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), and use Application Programming Interface (API) to automate networks tasks of Fault Management, Configuration Management, Accounting Management, Performance Management, and Security Management.
I have Applied Python and shell scripting to collect data from syslog and identify security risks and account activities. 
Used different approaches like CLI, telnet, SNMP to perform network management functions. 
Applied SNMP API to read/write configuration data (and traps) and conduct network management functions on Ethernet switches and IP router and used tools like MRTG to conduct performance analysis and generate time series graph
Developed a web site to perform network management functions and used API to automate networks tasks of Fault Management, Configuration Management, Accounting Management, Performance Management, and Security Management
